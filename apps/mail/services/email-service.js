None of us were familiar with web design or coding before, but your training and the manual / process checklist you wrote for us will ensure that weâ€™ll easily be able to make changes to the website as needed.\nYou were a pleasure to work with. Please call upon me should you ever need a positive testimonial to use on your own website.\nThanks again,\nCorey Carpenter (signature for hard copy letter)\nCorey Carpenter',
